                    This tells us what version of the program we need to fix, and can be found to the left of the minimize & close buttons on the top bar.  
                    If the program won't start, R+Click on the executable and select **Properties**, then navigate to the **Details** tab. Enter the version shown in the `Product version` field here.

                    We need to know what version of Windows you're using to diagnose the problem.  

                    To find this out, press **Win**+**R** to open the run dialog, then type `"winver"` and press **Enter** to open *About Windows*.

                    This tells us what happened, which helps us build a description of the bug we need to fix.  
                    Be specific, and include as much detail as possible.

                    This gives us an idea of what we should do to fix the problem, and/or provides you with a way to suggest what you want to happen.  
                    *(That doesn't mean we **will** (or can) fix it in the exact way that you want, but it does shape the way that we approach the problem.)*
      placeholder:  I expected the program to do *that*

                    This helps us replicate the conditions that led to the bug you experienced, so that we can observe the cause in a debugging environment.  
                    While this is optional, it is highly encouraged since it cuts the amount of time needed to fix the problem by half in cases where the cause isn't obvious.
