                    This tells us what the program was doing when the problem occurred.  
                    For the installer build, the log is located in `%LocalAppData%\radj307\VolumeControl`.  
                    For the portable build, the log is located in the same directory as `VolumeControl.exe`.  
                    
                    :warning: **Logs may contain file paths that include your Windows username. If you don't want your username to be visible publicly, use a text editor to replace all occurrences with `<USERNAME>` prior to posting.**
